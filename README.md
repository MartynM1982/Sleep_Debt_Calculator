# Sleep Debt Calculator
If we donâ€™t sleep enough, we accumulate sleep debt. In this project I will calculate if the user is getting enough sleep each week using a sleep debt calculator.

The program will determine the actual and ideal hours of sleep for each night of the last week.

Finally, it will return a message stating if the user has reached their target.
